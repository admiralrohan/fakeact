# Plan

Want to display a simple Counter in HTML
First only one component, append everything into root div
Later will think about composing multiple components

Next plan passing on props
Then reusing the Counter component, initialize with diff initial count

For blog, first without hierarchy, then hierachy, then onclick listeners
For now, no parentless elements, eg. use span for strings. Don't pass without parent.

div
span -> pop
/span -> pop

React fragment: You can only pass one element only
Wrapper component
